A new Flutter project.





## Getting Started
Learning is a deeply personal experience, and everyone has their unique way of understanding and absorbing information. Recognizing this, LearnGPT has been developed as an innovative educational app that tailors its responses to suit different learning styles. Whether you prefer detailed explanations, structured questioning, or concise summaries, LearnGPT adapts to your needs, providing an engaging and effective learning experience.





LearnGPT is designed to enhance the learning process by offering users the ability to choose from multiple AI-driven teaching personalities:
1) Alex: The expert teacher who provides thorough, well-structured explanations with relevant examples. Alex is ideal for learners who appreciate in-depth understanding and step-by-step guidance.
2) Alice: The strict teacher who emphasizes learning through a series of questions and answers. Alice challenges users with structured, thought-provoking queries, helping them understand concepts through active engagement.
3) Bob: The cool teacher who values brevity and clarity. Bob delivers concise and direct explanations, perfect for learners who prefer getting straight to the point without unnecessary details.
